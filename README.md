This Mileage Calculator is based on the MTCARS dataset. 
It utilizes a linear regression model to determine the influence of three variables on the car's mileage:  

- Weight  
- Transmission type

With such information, and the information provided by the user the Mileage Calculator is able to estimate the mileage any given car will produce.

Transmissions type - With this control, the user can select weather the vehicle has manual or automatic transmission.
Number of cylinders - This set of radio buttons allows the user to select the number of cylinders the vehicle for which the mileage calculator is being used has.
